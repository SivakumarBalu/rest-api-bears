# rest-api-bears
Simple REST API creation for CRUD using Express JS

We are going to build an API that will:

Handle CRUD for an item (we’re going to use bears)
Have a standard URL (http://example.com/api/bears and http://example.com/api/bears/:bear_id)
Use the proper HTTP verbs to make it RESTful (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE)
Return JSON data
Log all requests to the console
All of this is pretty standard for RESTful APIs. Feel free to switch out bears for anything that you will want to build for your application (users, superheroes, beers, etc).

Make sure you have Node installed and let’s get to it!
